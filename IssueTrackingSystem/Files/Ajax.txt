Asynchronous Javascript and xml.

instead of sending the complete page contents only the required data is sent to the server and the answer is got back. This is asynchronous transfer and is called partial 
page rendering.

AJAX = [Javascript + xml]  

html components are not controlled by c# so it wont have runat=server by default.
This is mainly used by html designers.
If mainly javascript uses the control better to use the html controls as against a standard control.

javascript runs at the client side so it cannot access server resources like it cannot access database this will lead to data insecurity
